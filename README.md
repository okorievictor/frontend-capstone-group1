## Project Summary

This application recreates a provided mockup as a fully working React web app. It fetches real planet data from an external API and displays it in a responsive grid of planet cards. It also includes a comparative NASA data table and a validated contact form. The project demonstrates HTML, CSS and JavaScript fundamentals, React component architecture, the Fetch API, responsive design, and collaborative Git workflows — all skills covered throughout the TS Academy Frontend Development course.
